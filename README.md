### About
Cafe Infinite is the working title I have for a project I've been thinking about for a long time. It's a simple platform I'd like to build to help connect people with their local businesses. With COVID, I don't see that being useful anytime soon, but hopefully I'll have it done by the time things return to normal, or to a new-normal.

### FireBase
After seeing [this introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag), I wanted to make a project using firebase.

### Stripe
I will handle payments using stripe.

### Google Maps
I will be using the Google maps API
