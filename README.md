### About
Cafe Infinite is the working title I have for a project I've been thinking about for a long time. It's a simple platform I'd like to build to help connect people with their local businesses. With COVID, I don't see that being useful anytime soon, but hopefully I'll have it done by the time things return to normal, or to a new-normal.

### FireBase
After seeing [this introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kRgVxULbag), I wanted to make a project using firebase.

### Stripe
I will handle payments using stripe.

### Google Maps
I will be using the Google maps API

1. Download the ‘reboot2’ branch of the project
2. Open project in code editor
3. Make sure you have npm and node installed and up to date
4. Run ‘npm install’ to download dependencies
5. Install firebase (through npm you can just run ‘npm i firebase’)
6. Install the firebase command line tools ‘npm i firebase-tools’
7. You’ll be prompted to install the java sdk (oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html)
8. Run ‘npm test’ from the command line
9. Check localhost:5000, the site should be running but it probably won’t be able to load google maps
